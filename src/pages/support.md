# Support

If you are experiencing problems using Apache Sunny, then please report your problem to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/apache/sunny/issues). You may also find it useful to discuss your issues with the community on the mailing list or Slack.

## How to get help

Whenever you are reporting a problem please be sure to include as much information as possible; the more we know the more chance of a quicker resolution:

* which Sunny version you are using
* what platform and JDK
* stack traces generally really help! If in doubt include the whole thing; often exceptions get wrapped in other exceptions right near the bottom explains the actual error, not the first few lines at the top.
* log output are very helpful too; sometimes enabling `DEBUG` logging can help
* your code & configuration files are useful. Be careful not to send us anything of a sensitive nature.
* did it work before? what have you changed?
* try upgrading to the latest release or SNAPSHOT and see if it's fixed
* search the user mailing list to see if has been discussed before
* check the issue tracker to see if the issue already have been reported
